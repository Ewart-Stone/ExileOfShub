The Last Test H.P.LoveCraft
Be careful, you! There are powers against your powers. 8:26 PM 7/3/2019I didn't go 
to China for nothing, and there are things in Alhazred's 
Azif which weren't known in Atlantis! We've both meddled 
in dangerous things, but you needn't think you know all my
resources. How about the Nemesis of Flame? I talked
in Yemen with an old man who had come back alive
from the Crimson Desert-he had seen Irem, the City
of Pillars, and had worshipped at the underground shrines
of Nug and Yeb-Ia! Shub-Niggurath!
